SD leads to progressive neurodegeneration and early death. \\nHowever, there is a lack of established SD biomarkers, while the pathogenesis \\netiology remains to be elucidated. To identify potential biomarkers and unveil \\nthe pathogenic mechanisms, metabolomics analysis with reverse phase liquid \\nchromatography (RPLC) was conducted. A total of 177, 112 and 119 metabolites \\nwere found to be significantly dysregulated in mouse liver, mouse brain and \\nhuman hippocampus samples, respectively (p\\u202f<\\u202f.05, ID score\\u202f>\\u202f0.5). Principal \\ncomponent analysis (PCA) analysis of the metabolites showed clear separation of \\nmetabolomics profiles between normal and diseased individuals. Among these \\nmetabolites, dipeptides, amino acids and derivatives were elevated, indicating a \\nrobust protein catabolism. Through pathway enrichment analysis, we also found \\nalterations in metabolites associated with neurotransmission, lipid metabolism, \\noxidative stress and inflammation. In addition, N-acetylgalactosamine \\n4-sulphate, key component of glycosaminoglycans (GAG) was significantly \\nelevated, which was also confirmed by biochemical assays. Collectively, these \\nresults indicated major shifts of energy utilization and profound metabolic \\nimpairments, contributing to the pathogenesis mechanisms of SD. Global \\nmetabolomics profiling may provide an innovative tool for better understanding \\nthe disease mechanisms, and identifying potential diagnostic biomarkers for SD.\",\n          \"Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) presents with sudden onset of visual \\nloss mainly in young adult males. LHON is not uncommon in Australia, accounting \\nfor 2% of invalid blind pensions. We have identified 20 unrelated families \\ncarrying mitochondrial DNA mutations associated with LHON and 135 of 291 \\nindividuals with documented LHON are currently alive in Australia. The mean age \\nof onset of visual loss for males was 26 years and for females 27 years, with a \\nrange from six to 65 years. The mean risk of visual loss was 20% for males and \\n4% for females. There are over 1750 male and female carriers living in Australia \\nwho have not yet lost vision; 600 carriers are under 24 years of age. The \\nexpected number of new cases of blindness from LHON is three to four per year.\",\n          \"CRISPR-Cas12a (Cpf1) proteins are RNA-guided enzymes that bind and cut DNA as \\ncomponents of bacterial adaptive immune systems. Like CRISPR-Cas9, Cas12a has \\nbeen harnessed for genome editing on the basis of its ability to generate \\ntargeted, double-stranded DNA breaks. Here we show that RNA-guided DNA binding \\nunleashes indiscriminate single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) cleavage activity by Cas12a \\nthat completely degrades ssDNA molecules. We find that target-activated, \\nnonspecific single-stranded deoxyribonuclease (ssDNase) cleavage is also a \\nproperty of other type V CRISPR-Cas12 enzymes. By combining Cas12a ssDNase \\nactivation with isothermal amplification, we create a method termed DNA \\nendonuclease-targeted CRISPR trans reporter (DETECTR), which achieves attomolar \\nsensitivity for DNA detection.

            "Generated Answer: Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) inhibitors are a class of compounds that target the molecular chaperone Hsp90, which plays a crucial role in protein folding, stability, and function. Hsp90 is involved in the folding and maturation of a wide range of client proteins, many of which are key regulators of cell growth, survival, and proliferation. Inhibition of Hsp90 leads to the destabilization and degradation of these client proteins, resulting in disruption of multiple signaling pathways critical for cancer cell survival and progression.\n",
            "\n",
            "The mode of action of Hsp90 inhibitors can be summarized as follows:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Client Protein Destabilization**: Hsp90 inhibitors bind to the ATP-binding pocket of Hsp90, preventing its ATPase activity. This leads to the stabilization of the Hsp90-client protein complex, resulting in the degradation of client proteins by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Many of these client proteins are oncoproteins, such as kinases (e.g., EGFR, HER2), transcription factors (e.g., HIF-1α, AR), and cell cycle regulators (e.g., CDK4, CDK6).\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Induction of Proteotoxic Stress**: Inhibition of Hsp90 disrupts the protein folding machinery, leading to the accumulation of misfolded proteins and inducing proteotoxic stress within the cell. This stress triggers the unfolded protein response (UPR) and activates cellular pathways involved in protein degradation and quality control.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Apoptosis Induction**: The destabilization of client proteins critical for cell survival and proliferation can trigger apoptotic cell death. Hsp90 inhibitors have been shown to induce apoptosis in cancer cells by disrupting anti-apoptotic signaling pathways and promoting pro-apoptotic signals.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Anti-Angiogenic Effects**: Hsp90 inhibitors can also inhibit angiogenesis by targeting client proteins involved in the regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling and other pro-angiogenic pathways, thereby suppressing the formation of new blood vessels that are essential for tumor growth and metastasis.\n",

Although these two \\ntranscription factors are able to form two homodimers and one heterodimer, it is \\nmainly the heterodimer that participates in the formation of this enhanceosome, \\nbinding specifically to the positive regulatory domain IV (PRDIV) site of the \\nenhancer DNA. To understand this surprising advantage of the heterodimer, we \\ninvestigated the association of these transcription factors using fragments \\ncontaining the basic DNA-recognition segment and the basic leucine zipper domain \\n(bZIP). It was found that the probability of forming the hetero-bZIP \\nsignificantly exceeds the probability of forming homo-bZIPs, and that the \\nhetero-bZIP interacts more strongly with the PRDIV site of the interferon-beta \\nenhancer, especially in the orientation that places the folded ATF-2 basic \\nsegment in the upstream half of this asymmetric site. The effect of salt on the \\nformation of the ATF-2/c-Jun dimer and on its ability to bind the target PRDIV \\nsite showed that electrostatic interactions between the charged groups of these \\nproteins and with DNA play an essential role in the formation of the asymmetric \\nATF-2/c-Jun/PRDIV complex.\\n[2] It is well established that mitochondrial fragmentation plays a key role in the \\npathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Mitochondrial fission is mediated by \\ndynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), which is highly expressed in nervous system \\nand regulated by various posttranslational modifications including \\nphosphorylation. We identified glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)3β-dependent Drp1 \\nphosphorylation at Ser(40) and Ser(44), which increases Drp1 GTPase activity and \\nits mitochondrial distribution and could induce mitochondrial fragmentation. \\nMoreover, neurons transfected with Ser(40)Ser(44) phosphomimic Drp1 showed \\nincreased mitochondria fragmentation and were more vulnerable to amyloid-β \\n(Aβ)-induced apoptosis. Therefore, blocking GSK3β-induced Drp1 phosphorylation \\nmay be an effective way to protect neurons from Aβ toxicity. To address this, we \\ndesigned and synthesized an artificial polypeptide named TAT-Drp1-SpS, which \\ncould specifically block GSK3β-induced Drp1 phosphorylation. Our results \\ndemonstrated that TAT-Drp1-SpS treatment could significantly reduce Aβ-induced \\nneuronal apoptosis in cultured neurons. Notably, TAT-Drp1-SpS administration in \\nhippocampus Cornu Ammonis 1 (CA1) region significantly reduced Aβ burden and \\nrescued the memory deficits in AD transgenic mice. Although Aβ has multiple \\ntargets to exert its neurotoxicity, our findings suggested that GSK3β-induced \\nmitochondrial fragmentation was, at least partially, mediated by Aβ toxicity and \\ncontribute to the pathogenesis of AD. Taken together, GSK3β-induced Drp1 \\nphosphorylation provides a novel mechanism for mitochondrial fragmentation in \\nAD, and our findings suggested a novel therapeutic strategy for AD.\\n[3] The transport of apolipoprotein B (apoB) between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) \\nand Golgi was studied in puromycin-synchronized HepG2 cells, using an antibody \\nthat could distinguish between apoB in ER and Golgi compartments. In cells with \\nnormal ER-to-Golgi transport, both albumin and apoB colocalized throughout the \\nER and appeared as intense, compact signals in Golgi. When ER-to-Golgi transport \\nwas blocked with brefeldin A, apoB and albumin remained colocalized in the ER \\nnetwork and three-dimensional constructed images showed more intense signals for \\nboth proteins in a central, perinuclear region of the ER. When protein synthesis \\nwas stopped in cells with brefeldin A-inhibited ER-to-Golgi transport, apoB \\ndegradation was visualized as a homogeneous decrease in fluorescence signal \\nintensity throughout the ER that could be slowed with clasto-lactacystin \\nbeta-lactone, a proteasome inhibitor. Incubation of cells with CP-10447, an \\ninhibitor of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, inhibited apoB, but not \\nalbumin, transport from ER to Golgi. Nanogold immunoelectron microscopy of \\ndigitonin-permeabilized cells showed proteasomes in close proximity to the \\ncytosolic side of the ER membrane. Thus, newly synthesized apoB is localized \\nthroughout the entire ER and degraded homogeneously, most likely by neighboring \\nproteasomes located on the cytosolic side of the ER membrane.

A total of 177, 112 and 119 metabolites \\nwere found to be significantly dysregulated in mouse liver, mouse brain and \\nhuman hippocampus samples, respectively (p\\u202f<\\u202f.05, ID score\\u202f>\\u202f0.5). Principal \\ncomponent analysis (PCA) analysis of the metabolites showed clear separation of \\nmetabolomics profiles between normal and diseased individuals. Among these \\nmetabolites, dipeptides, amino acids and derivatives were elevated, indicating a \\nrobust protein catabolism. Through pathway enrichment analysis, we also found \\nalterations in metabolites associated with neurotransmission, lipid metabolism, \\noxidative stress and inflammation. In addition, N-acetylgalactosamine \\n4-sulphate, key component of glycosaminoglycans (GAG) was significantly \\nelevated, which was also confirmed by biochemical assays. Collectively, these \\nresults indicated major shifts of energy utilization and profound metabolic \\nimpairments, contributing to the pathogenesis mechanisms of SD. Global \\nmetabolomics profiling may provide an innovative tool for better understanding \\nthe disease mechanisms, and identifying potential diagnostic biomarkers for SD.\\n[3] INTRODUCTION: This study investigated five confirmed rheumatoid arthritis (RA) \\nsusceptibility genes/loci (HLA-DRB1, PTPN22, STAT4, OLIG3/TNFAIP3 and TRAF1/C5) \\nfor association with susceptibility and severity in an inception cohort.\\nMETHODS: The magnitude of association for each genotype was assessed in 1,046 RA \\nsubjects from the Yorkshire Early RA cohort and in 5,968 healthy UK controls. \\nAdditional exploratory subanalyses were undertaken in subgroups defined by \\nautoantibody status (rheumatoid factor and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide) or \\ndisease severity (baseline articular erosions, Health Assessment Questionnaire \\n(HAQ) score and swollen joint count (SJC)).\\nRESULTS: In the total RA inception cohort, the HLA-DRB1 shared epitope \\n(per-allele odds ratio (OR) = 2.1, trend P < 0.0001), PTPN22 (per-allele OR = \\n1.5, trend P < 0.0001), OLIG3/TNFAIP3 locus (per-allele OR = 1.2, trend P = \\n0.009) and TRAF1/C5 locus (per-allele OR = 1.1, trend P = 0.04) were associated \\nwith RA. The magnitude of association for these loci was increased in those \\npatients who were autoantibody-positive. PTPN22 was associated with \\nautoantibody-negative RA (per-allele OR = 1.3, trend P = 0.04). There was no \\nevidence of association between these five genetic loci and baseline erosions or \\nSJC in the total RA cohort, after adjustment for symptom duration. TRAF1/C5 was \\nsignificantly associated with baseline HAQ, however, following adjustment for \\nsymptom duration (P trend = 0.03).\\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings support the mounting evidence that different genetic \\nloci are associated with autoantibody-positive and autoantibody-negative RA, \\npossibly suggesting that many of the genes identified to date are associated \\nwith autoantibody production. Additional studies with a specific focus on \\nautoantibody-negative RA will be needed to identify the genes predisposing to \\nthis RA subgroup. The TRAF1/C5 locus in particular warrants further \\ninvestigation in RA as a potential disease severity locus.'}], 'average_scores': {'accuracy': 0.5, 'completeness': 0.5, 'relevance': 0.5}}\n"

            "Generated Answer: Deubiquitinase USP25 is a protein that belongs to the ubiquitin-specific protease (USP) family, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of protein degradation and turnover by removing ubiquitin molecules from target proteins. The specificity of deubiquitinase USP25 refers to its ability to selectively recognize and cleave specific ubiquitin chains or substrates, thereby influencing various cellular processes.\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Substrate Specificity**: USP25 exhibits substrate specificity by recognizing and deubiquitinating specific target proteins. This specificity can be determined by the sequence or structure of the ubiquitin chains attached to the substrate proteins. USP25 may preferentially act on certain types of ubiquitin linkages or modifications, such as K48-linked or K63-linked ubiquitin chains, depending on its interacting partners and cellular context.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Regulation of Signaling Pathways**: USP25's specificity in deubiquitinating target proteins can modulate various signaling pathways within the cell. By removing ubiquitin moieties from specific substrates, USP25 can regulate protein stability, localization, and activity, thereby impacting cellular processes like DNA repair, cell cycle progression, and immune response.\n",

            "Generated Answer: Lasmiditan is a novel drug approved by the FDA for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults. It belongs to a class of medications known as \"ditans\" and works by selectively targeting serotonin receptors in the brain to alleviate migraine symptoms. Unlike traditional migraine medications like triptans, Lasmiditan does not constrict blood vessels, making it a suitable option for individuals with cardiovascular risk factors or those who cannot tolerate triptans.\n",
