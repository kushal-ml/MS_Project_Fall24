It has anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties and acts as an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase which results in the inhibition of the biosynthesis of prostaglandins. Aspirin also inhibits platelet aggregation and is used in the prevention of arterial and venous thrombosis. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p5)\n\nConcept: C0270549 - Generalized anxiety disorder\nDefinition: An anxiety disorder characterized by excessive and difficult-to-control worry about a number of life situations. The worry is accompanied by restlessness, fatigue, inability to concentrate, irritability, muscle tension, and/or sleep disturbance and lasts for at least 6 months.\n\nConcept: C0344428 - ECG: ventricular tachycardia (finding)\nDefinition: An electrocardiographic finding of three or more consecutive complexes of ventricular organ with a rate greater than a certain threshold (100 or 120 beats per minute are commonly used). The QRS complexes are wide and have an abnormal morphology. (CDISC)\n\nConcept: C0264711 - Past myocardial infarction diagnosed on ECG AND/OR other special investigation, but currently presenting no symptoms\nDefinition: None\n\nConcept: C0235716 - Burning chest pain\nDefinition: The sensation of chest pain described as an intense discomfort, similar to that experience as a result of a thermal burn, distinct from sharp, stabbing or aching, often related to nerves; sometimes used to describe gastric or esophageal pain.\n\nConcept: C0344423 - ECG: atrial flutter (finding)\nDefinition: An electrocardiographic finding of an organized, regular atrial rhythm with atrial rate of 240-340 beats per minute. Multiple P waves typically appear in the inferior leads in a saw tooth like pattern between the QRS complexes. (CDISC)\n\nConcept: C0349231 - Phobic anxiety disorder\nDefinition: Anxiety disorders in which the essential feature is persistent and irrational fear of a specific object, activity, or situation that the individual feels compelled to avoid.\n\nConcept: C0268124 - Adenosine deaminase deficiency\nDefinition: An autosomal recessive deficiency of the purine salvage enzyme adenosine deaminase which results in Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Disease (SCID). The most common form of SCID, accounting for about 50% of autosomal recessive cases. The first disease for which gene therapy was applied.\n\nConcept: C0344434 - ECG: atrial fibrillation (finding)\nDefinition: An electrocardiographic finding of a supraventricular arrhythmia characterized by the replacement of consistent P waves by rapid oscillations or fibrillatory waves that vary in size, shape and timing and are accompanied by an irregularly irregular ventricular response. (CDISC)\n\nConcept: C0012131 - 2',3'-Dideoxyadenosine\nDefinition: A dideoxynucleoside compound in which the 3'-hydroxy group on the sugar moiety has been replaced by a hydrogen. This modification prevents the formation of phosphodiester linkages which are needed for the completion of nucleic acid chains. The compound is an inhibitor of HIV replication, acting as a chain-terminator of viral DNA by binding to reverse transcriptase. Its principal side effect is nephrotoxicity. In vivo, dideoxyadenosine is rapidly metabolized to DIDANOSINE (ddI) by enzymatic deamination; ddI is then converted to dideoxyinosine monophosphate and ultimately to dideoxyadenosine triphosphate, the putative active metabolite.\n\nConcept: C0344435 - ECG: ventricular fibrillation (finding)\nDefinition: An electrocardiographic finding of a rapid grossly irregular ventricular rhythm with marked variability in QRS cycle length, morphology, and amplitude. The rate is typically greater than 300 bpm. (CDISC)\n\nConcept: C0013799 - Ambulatory ECG\nDefinition: Method in which prolonged electrocardiographic recordings are made on a portable tape recorder (Holter-type system) or solid-state device (real-time system), while the patient undergoes normal daily activities. It is useful in the diagnosis and management of intermittent cardiac arrhythmias and transient myocardial ischemia.\n\nConcept: C0033216 - procainamide\nDefinition: A class Ia antiarrhythmic drug that is structurally-related to PROCAINE.\n\nConcept: C0289969 - 2-Chloro-N(6)-(3-iodobenzyl)adenosine-5'-N-methyluronamide\nDefinition: An orally bioavailable, synthetic, highly selective adenosine A3 receptor (A3AR) agonist with potential antineoplastic activity. Namodenoson selectively binds to and activates the cell surface-expressed A3AR, deregulating Wnt and NF-kB signal transduction pathways downstream, which may result in apoptosis of A3AR-expressing tumor cells. A3AR, a G protein-coupled receptor, is highly expressed on the cell surfaces of various solid tumor cell types, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, and plays an important role in cellular proliferation.\n\nConcept: C0002996 - Balloon Angioplasty\nDefinition: Use of a balloon catheter for dilation of an occluded artery. It is used in treatment of arterial occlusive diseases, including renal artery stenosis and arterial occlusions in the leg. For the specific technique of BALLOON DILATION in coronary arteries, ANGIOPLASTY, BALLOON, CORONARY is available.\n\nConcept: C0361046 - aspirin 500 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet [Anadin All-Night]\nDefinition: None\n\nConcept: C0344424 - ECG: ventricular arrhythmia (finding)\nDefinition: An electrocardiographic finding of an atypical cardiac rhythm resulting from a pathologic process in the cardiac ventricles.\n\nConcept: C0397679 - Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of femoral artery\nDefinition: The insertion of a catheter that use x-ray guidance to repair an abnormality in the femoral artery.\n\nConcept: C0340960 - Adenosine deaminase superactivity\nDefinition: A rare genetic haematologic disease characterised by mild chronic haemolytic anaemia (due to highly elevated adenosine deaminase activity in red blood cells resulting in their premature destruction), elevated reticulocyte count, splenomegaly and mild hyperbilirubinaemia. Other cells and tissues are not affected.\n\nConcept: C0350592 - aspirin 600 MG Delayed Release Oral Tablet [Nu-Seals Aspirin]\nDefinition: None\n\nConcept: C0169868 - 8-Chloroadenosine\nDefinition: An antimetabolite and a chlorine derivative of the purine nucleoside adenosine, with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, 8-chloro-adenosine is phosphorylated to form 8-chloro-adenosine triphosphate (8-chloro-ATP), which functions as a ribonucleoside analogue and competes with ATP during transcription. Therefore, this agent causes RNA synthesis inhibition, inhibits cellular proliferation, and induces apoptosis.\n\nConcept: C0344413 - ECG: heart block (finding)\nDefinition: An electrocardiographic finding of blocked cardiac electrical impulses along the fibers normally responsible for impulse conduction.\n\nConcept: C0457037 - Anxiety about having a heart attack\nDefinition: None\n\nConcept: C0001464 - Adenosine kinase\nDefinition: An enzyme that catalyzes the formation of ADP plus AMP from adenosine plus ATP. It can serve as a salvage mechanism for returning adenosine to nucleic acids. EC 2.7.1.20.\n\nConcept: C0202882 - Infusion of intra-arterial thrombolytic agent with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, multiple vessels\nDefinition: None\n\nConcept: C0338997 - Disturbance of anxiety and fearfulness in childhood and adolescence\nDefinition: None\n\nConcept: C0202880 -
