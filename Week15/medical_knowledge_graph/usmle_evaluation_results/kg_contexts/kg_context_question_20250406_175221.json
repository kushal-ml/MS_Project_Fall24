It has anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties and acts as an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase which results in the inhibition of the biosynthesis of prostaglandins. Aspirin also inhibits platelet aggregation and is used in the prevention of arterial and venous thrombosis. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p5)\n\nConcept: C0065374 - lisinopril\nDefinition: One of the ANGIOTENSIN-CONVERTING ENZYME INHIBITORS (ACE inhibitors), orally active, that has been used in the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure.\n\nConcept: C0155626 - Acute myocardial infarction\nDefinition: Necrosis of the myocardium, as a result of interruption of the blood supply to the area. It is characterized by a severe and rapid onset of symptoms that may include chest pain, often radiating to the left arm and left side of the neck, dyspnea, sweating, and palpitations.\n\nConcept: C0025859 - metoprolol\nDefinition: A selective adrenergic beta-1 blocking agent that is commonly used to treat ANGINA PECTORIS; HYPERTENSION; and CARDIAC ARRHYTHMIAS.\n\nConcept: C0019139 - Low molecular weight heparin\nDefinition: Heparin fractions with a molecular weight usually between 4000 and 6000 kD. These low-molecular-weight fractions are effective antithrombotic agents. Their administration reduces the risk of hemorrhage, they have a longer half-life, and their platelet interactions are reduced in comparison to unfractionated heparin. They also provide an effective prophylaxis against postoperative major pulmonary embolism.\n\nConcept: C0003868 - Gouty arthritis\nDefinition: Arthritis, especially of the great toe, as a result of gout. Acute gouty arthritis often is precipitated by trauma, infection, surgery, etc. The initial attacks are usually monoarticular but later attacks are often polyarticular. Acute and chronic gouty arthritis are associated with accumulation of MONOSODIUM URATE in and around affected joints.\n\nConcept: C0054452 - heparin calcium\nDefinition: The calcium salt form of heparin. As a glycosaminoglycan anticoagulant, heparin calcium binds to antithrombin III to form a heparin-antithrombin III complex. The complex binds to and irreversibly inactivates thrombin and other activated clotting factors IX, X, XI, and XII and prevents the transformation of fibrinogen to fibrin. Check for \"https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/clinical-trials/intervention/C1034\" active clinical trials using this agent. (\"http://ncit.nci.nih.gov/ncitbrowser/ConceptReport.jsp?dictionary=NCI%20Thesaurus&code=C1034\" NCI Thesaurus)\n\nConcept: C0037513 - heparin sodium\nDefinition: The sodium salt form of heparin. As a glycosaminoglycan anticoagulant, heparin sodium binds to antithrombin III to form a heparin-antithrombin III complex. The complex binds to and irreversibly inactivates thrombin and other activated clotting factors IX, X, XI, and XII and prevents the transformation of fibrinogen to fibrin. Check for \"https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/clinical-trials/intervention/C833\" active clinical trials using this agent. (\"http://ncit.nci.nih.gov/ncitbrowser/ConceptReport.jsp?dictionary=NCI%20Thesaurus&code=C833\" NCI Thesaurus)\n\nConcept: C0019142 - heparinoids\nDefinition: Heparin derivatives. The term has also been used more loosely to include naturally occurring and synthetic highly-sulphated polysaccharides of similar structure. Heparinoid preparations have been used for a wide range of applications including as anticoagulants and anti-inflammatories and they have been claimed to have hypolipidemic properties. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th, p232)\n\nConcept: C0348876 - Thrombosis of atrium, auricular appendage, and ventricle due to and following acute myocardial infarction\nDefinition: None\n\nConcept: C0350132 - metoprolol fumarate\nDefinition: The fumarate salt form of metoprolol, a cardioselective competitive beta-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist with antihypertensive properties and devoid of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Metoprolol antagonizes beta 1-adrenergic receptors in the myocardium, thereby reducing the rate and force of myocardial contraction, and consequently a diminished cardiac output. This agent may also reduce the secretion of renin with subsequent reduction in levels of angiotensin II thereby preventing vasoconstriction and aldosterone secretion.\n\nConcept: C0151175 - Cutaneous gonorrhea\nDefinition: WHAT: Gonococcal skin lesions.\tGonococcal Skin Lesions: hemorrhagic or vesicopustular skin lesions characteristically seen in disseminated gonococcal infections.\tWHY:\tThe presence of gonococcal skin lesions in a patient with arthritis is highly suggestive of gonococcal arthritis.\tHOW:\tTwo types of mature skin lesions are consistently seen in gonococcal bacteremia. One is a hemorrhagic (purpuric) papule. The other is a vesicopustular lesion on an erythematous base. Both lesions begin as pinpoint erythematous macules, and typically appear during the first day of symptoms in association with a febrile episode. The purpuric lesions do not blanch with local pressure and often are found on the palms and the soles. They last about a week gradually fading from a dark blue color to a dark brown and then a light brownish yellow color. The vesicopustular lesions evolve through papular, vesicular and pustular stages reaching a maximum diameter of about 2.5 cm. All these stages may be present at the same time. The mature lesion is elevated, slightly umbilicated and surrounded by an erythematous areola. It usually involutes after 4-5 days. The lesions are usually tender and are located on the distal parts of the extremities. The trunk of the body is generally not involved with either lesion. In some cases the purpuric element predominates, while in others the pustular predominates. Rarely, a third variant, a hemorrhagic bulla, will be the sole skin manifestation of gonococcal bacteremia.\tREFS:\t1) Holmes, KK; Counts, GW and Beaty, HN: Disseminated gonococcal infection. Ann Intern Med 74:979, 1971. 2) Ackerman, AB: Hemorrhagic bullae in gonococcemia. N Engl J Med 282:793, 1970. DN19233-3.\n\nConcept: C0033802 - Pseudogout\nDefinition: presence of calcium salts, especially calcium pyrophosphate, in the cartilaginous structures of one or more joints, accompanied by attacks of goutlike symptoms.\n\nConcept: C0074554 - simvastatin\nDefinition: a derivative of lovastatin and inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG coA reductase), a rate limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of cholesterol.\n\nConcept: C0018099 - Gout\nDefinition: Metabolic disorder characterized by recurrent acute arthritis, hyperuricemia and deposition of sodium urate in and around the joints, sometimes with formation of URIC ACID calculi.\n\nConcept: C0314959 - Bacteroides heparinolyticus\nDefinition: A species of obligately anaerobic, Gram-negative, rod shaped bacteria assigned to the phylum Bacteroidetes. This species is nonmotile, non-spore forming, nonpigmented, xylose, arabinose, cellobiose, salicin, sucrose, lactose, indole, esculin hydrolysis, alpha-fucosidase, beta-xylosidase, beta-glucosidase, and glycine aminopeptidase positive. P. heparinolytica has been isolated from the oral cavity and is associated with oral infections.\n\nConcept: C0018100 - Antigout agent\nDefinition: Agents that increase uric acid excretion by the kidney (URICOSURIC AGENTS), decrease uric acid production (antihyperuricemics), or alleviate the pain and inflammation of acute attacks of gout.\n\nConcept: C0348867 - Rupture of cardiac wall without hemopericardium as current complication following acute myocardial infarction\nDefinition: None\n\nConcept: C0272285 - Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia\nDefinition: A life-threatening complication of heparin therapy.
