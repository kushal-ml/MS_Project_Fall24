It stimulates both the alpha- and beta- adrenergic systems, causes systemic VASOCONSTRICTION and gastrointestinal relaxation, stimulates the HEART, and dilates BRONCHI and cerebral vessels. It is used in ASTHMA and CARDIAC FAILURE and to delay absorption of local ANESTHETICS.\n\nConcept: C0012522 - diphenhydramine\nDefinition: A histamine H1 antagonist used as an antiemetic, antitussive, for dermatoses and pruritus, for hypersensitivity reactions, as a hypnotic, an antiparkinson, and as an ingredient in common cold preparations. It has some undesired antimuscarinic and sedative effects.\n\nConcept: C0035258 - Restless legs syndrome\nDefinition: A disorder characterized by aching or burning sensations in the lower and rarely the upper extremities that occur prior to sleep or may awaken the patient from sleep.\n\nConcept: C0001927 - albuterol\nDefinition: A short-acting beta-2 adrenergic agonist that is primarily used as a bronchodilator agent to treat ASTHMA. Albuterol is prepared as a racemic mixture of R(-) and S(+) stereoisomers. The stereospecific preparation of R(-) isomer of albuterol is referred to as levalbuterol.\n\nConcept: C0004963 - diphenhydramine hydrochloride\nDefinition: The hydrochloride salt form of diphenhydramine, an ethanolamine and first-generation histamine antagonist with anti-allergic activity. Diphenhydramine hydrochloride competitively blocks H1receptors, thereby preventing the actions of histamine on bronchial smooth muscle, capillaries, and gastrointestinal (GI) smooth muscle. This prevents histamine-induced bronchoconstriction, vasodilation, increased capillary permeability, and GI smooth muscle spasms. Check for \"https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/clinical-trials/intervention/C300\" active clinical trials using this agent. (\"http://ncit.nci.nih.gov/ncitbrowser/ConceptReport.jsp?dictionary=NCI%20Thesaurus&code=C300\" NCI Thesaurus)\n\nConcept: C0054120 - bromodiphenhydramine\nDefinition: A brominated derivative of diphenhydramine, an ethanolamine derivative and histamine H1 receptor antagonist with anti-allergic, sedative, antiemetic and anticholinergic properties. Bromazine competitively and selectively blocks central and peripheral histamine H1 receptors, thereby alleviating the symptoms caused by endogenous histamine on bronchial, capillary and gastrointestinal (GI) smooth muscles. This prevents histamine-induced bronchoconstriction, vasodilation, increased capillary permeability, itching, and spasmodic contractions of GI smooth muscle. In addition, bromazine binds to and blocks peripheral and central muscarinic receptors.\n\nConcept: C0028351 - norepinephrine\nDefinition: Precursor of epinephrine that is secreted by the ADRENAL MEDULLA and is a widespread central and autonomic neurotransmitter. Norepinephrine is the principal transmitter of most postganglionic sympathetic fibers, and of the diffuse projection system in the brain that arises from the LOCUS CERULEUS. It is also found in plants and is used pharmacologically as a sympathomimetic.\n\nConcept: C0002645 - amoxicillin\nDefinition: A broad-spectrum semisynthetic antibiotic similar to AMPICILLIN except that its resistance to gastric acid permits higher serum levels with oral administration.\n\nConcept: C0304299 - bromodiphenhydramine hydrochloride\nDefinition: The hydrochloride salt form of bromodiphenhydramine, a synthetic ethanolamine with histamine H1 antagonistic and sedative properties. Bromodiphenhydramine hydrochloride blocks the H1 histamine receptor and prevents the symptoms that are caused by histamine activity on capillaries, bronchial smooth muscle, and gastrointestinal smooth muscle, including vasodilation, increased capillary permeability, bronchoconstriction, and spasmodic contraction of gastrointestinal smooth muscle. This drug also prevents histamine-induced pain and itching of mucous membranes.\n\nConcept: C0085117 - Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis\nDefinition: Gel electrophoresis in which the direction of the electric field is changed periodically. This technique is similar to other electrophoretic methods normally used to separate double-stranded DNA molecules ranging in size up to tens of thousands of base-pairs. However, by alternating the electric field direction one is able to separate DNA molecules up to several million base-pairs in length.\n\nConcept: C0001636 - epinephrine hydrochloride\nDefinition: The hydrochloride salt of the naturally occurring sympathomimetic amine with vasoconstricting, intraocular pressure-reducing, and bronchodilating activities. By stimulating vascular alpha-adrenergic receptors, epinephrine causes vasoconstriction, thereby increasing vascular resistance and blood pressure. When administered in the conjunctiva, this agent binds to alpha-adrenergic receptors in the iris sphincter muscle, resulting in vasoconstriction, a decrease in the production of aqueous humor, and a lowering of intraocular pressure. Through its beta1 receptor-stimulating actions, epinephrine increases the force and rate of myocardial contraction and relaxes bronchial smooth muscle, resulting in bronchodilation.\n\nConcept: C0028333 - norepinephrine bitartrate\nDefinition: A bitartrate salt of norepinephrine, a synthetic phenylethylamine that mimics the sympathomimetic actions of the endogenous norepinephrine. Norepinephrine bitartrate acts directly on the alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors. Clinically, norepinephrine is used as a peripheral vasoconstrictor that causes constriction of arterial and venous beds via its alpha-adrenergic action. It is also used as a potent inotropic and chronotropic stimulator of the heart mediated through its beta-1 adrenergic action.\n\nConcept: C0232117 - Pulse rate\nDefinition: The rate of the pulse as observed in an artery, expressed as beats per minute. It can be measured at several anatomic sites, including the wrist, neck, temple, groin, behind the knees, or on top of the foot.\n\nConcept: C0235472 - Abnormal pulse\nDefinition: An anomaly of the rhythmic throbbing of an artery that reflects the widening of the artery as blood flows through it and is caused by successive contractions of the heart. []\n\nConcept: C0406127 - Chronic folliculitis of legs\nDefinition: None\n\nConcept: C0160830 - Abrasion or friction burn of trunk, without mention of infection, NOS\nDefinition: None\n\nConcept:

None\n\nConcept: C0229908 - Structure of subclavian lymphatic trunk\nDefinition: Trunk of lymphatic tree organ part, each instance of which is a trunk that drain some axillary lymphatic chains (lymph nodes and lymphatic vessels); the one on the right drains into some right lymphatic duct or subclavian vein, and the one on the left drains into some thoracic duct or subclavian vein.\n\nConcept:

the puerperium - delivered\nDefinition: None\n\nConcept: C0226273 - Structure of costocervical trunk\nDefinition: Trunk of branch of subclavian artery, each instance of which is an artery that arises from the posterior aspect of some subclavian artery, arches backward, and at the neck of some first rib bifurcates into the trunks of some deep cervical and highest intercostal arteries, thus supplying blood to the structures contained in some first two intercostal spaces, the vertebral column, the muscles of some back, and some deep neck muscles.\n\nConcept: C0342066 - Varicose veins of legs in pregnancy and the puerperium - delivered with postnatal complication\nDefinition: None\n\nConcept: C0204616 - Biofeedback training in regulation of blood pressure for essential hypertension\nDefinition: None\n\n\n## Relationships\n\nRelationship: diphenhydramine \u2192 SAME_AS \u2192 diphenhydramine\n\nRelationship: diphenhydramine \u2192 HAS_ACTIVE_INGREDIENT \u2192
