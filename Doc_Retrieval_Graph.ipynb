SD leads to progressive neurodegeneration and early death. \\nHowever, there is a lack of established SD biomarkers, while the pathogenesis \\netiology remains to be elucidated. To identify potential biomarkers and unveil \\nthe pathogenic mechanisms, metabolomics analysis with reverse phase liquid \\nchromatography (RPLC) was conducted. A total of 177, 112 and 119 metabolites \\nwere found to be significantly dysregulated in mouse liver, mouse brain and \\nhuman hippocampus samples, respectively (p\\u202f<\\u202f.05, ID score\\u202f>\\u202f0.5). Principal \\ncomponent analysis (PCA) analysis of the metabolites showed clear separation of \\nmetabolomics profiles between normal and diseased individuals. Among these \\nmetabolites, dipeptides, amino acids and derivatives were elevated, indicating a \\nrobust protein catabolism. Through pathway enrichment analysis, we also found \\nalterations in metabolites associated with neurotransmission, lipid metabolism, \\noxidative stress and inflammation. In addition, N-acetylgalactosamine \\n4-sulphate, key component of glycosaminoglycans (GAG) was significantly \\nelevated, which was also confirmed by biochemical assays. Collectively, these \\nresults indicated major shifts of energy utilization and profound metabolic \\nimpairments, contributing to the pathogenesis mechanisms of SD. Global \\nmetabolomics profiling may provide an innovative tool for better understanding \\nthe disease mechanisms, and identifying potential diagnostic biomarkers for SD.\",\n          \"Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) presents with sudden onset of visual \\nloss mainly in young adult males. LHON is not uncommon in Australia, accounting \\nfor 2% of invalid blind pensions. We have identified 20 unrelated families \\ncarrying mitochondrial DNA mutations associated with LHON and 135 of 291 \\nindividuals with documented LHON are currently alive in Australia. The mean age \\nof onset of visual loss for males was 26 years and for females 27 years, with a \\nrange from six to 65 years. The mean risk of visual loss was 20% for males and \\n4% for females. There are over 1750 male and female carriers living in Australia \\nwho have not yet lost vision; 600 carriers are under 24 years of age. The \\nexpected number of new cases of blindness from LHON is three to four per year.\",\n          \"CRISPR-Cas12a (Cpf1) proteins are RNA-guided enzymes that bind and cut DNA as \\ncomponents of bacterial adaptive immune systems. Like CRISPR-Cas9, Cas12a has \\nbeen harnessed for genome editing on the basis of its ability to generate \\ntargeted, double-stranded DNA breaks. Here we show that RNA-guided DNA binding \\nunleashes indiscriminate single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) cleavage activity by Cas12a \\nthat completely degrades ssDNA molecules. We find that target-activated, \\nnonspecific single-stranded deoxyribonuclease (ssDNase) cleavage is also a \\nproperty of other type V CRISPR-Cas12 enzymes. By combining Cas12a ssDNase \\nactivation with isothermal amplification, we create a method termed DNA \\nendonuclease-targeted CRISPR trans reporter (DETECTR), which achieves attomolar \\nsensitivity for DNA detection.

            "Answer: Membrane scission refers to the process of physically separating or dividing a membrane structure into two distinct parts. In the context of mitochondrial dynamics and Alzheimer's disease (AD), mitochondrial fragmentation plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of AD. Mitochondrial fission, which involves the scission of mitochondria into smaller fragments, is mediated by dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1). Drp1 is regulated by various posttranslational modifications, including phosphorylation. Specifically, glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)3β-dependent phosphorylation of Drp1 at specific serine residues (Ser(40) and Ser(44)) increases Drp1 GTPase activity, leading to mitochondrial fragmentation. This process of mitochondrial scission contributes to the pathogenesis of AD by affecting neuronal health and susceptibility to amyloid-β-induced apoptosis. Inhibition of GSK3β-induced Drp1 phosphorylation has been proposed as a potential therapeutic strategy to protect neurons from amyloid-β toxicity and reduce neuronal apoptosis in AD.\n",
